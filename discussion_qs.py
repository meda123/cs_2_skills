# Part One: Recursion 

""" 
1. In your own words, what is recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself, it can call
itself once or more inside the function body. 

2. Why is it necessary to have a base case?
A base case is necessary because it is how we signal to the function that we're
done recursing. In other words, without a base case, you'll have infinite recursion.

# Graphs 

"""
1. What is a graph?
A graph is a data structure, where a node is a basic unit of a graph, and an edge 
connects nodes. A graph can de directed or un-directed. 


2. How is a graph different from a tree?
Unlike a tree, graphs contain loops (also known as cycles)


3.Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.
A food chain depicting who eats whom lends itself really well to be modeled by 
a directed graph.
